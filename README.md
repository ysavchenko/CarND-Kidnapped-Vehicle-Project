# Runaway Vehicle Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program.

## Project description

In this project I'm utilizing particle filters to localize moving vehicle on the map.

In my tests particle filter implemented in `ParticleFilter` class successfully finishes 100 seconds simulation run with acceptable error values.

## Running instructions

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall uWebSocketIO for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu to install uWebSocketIO.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./particle_filter

Alternatively some scripts have been included to streamline this process, these can be leveraged by executing the following in the top directory of the project:

1. ./clean.sh
2. ./build.sh
3. ./run.sh
